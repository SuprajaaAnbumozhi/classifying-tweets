We are going to train 1 baseline (ZeroR) and 4 Machine Learning models (Decision Tree classifier, Naive Bayes, SGD classifier and MLP classifier). The trained model is used to find the accuracy and F1 score of the development dataset.

If you run the file with the provided dataset in the same folder, this file will run smoothly.
